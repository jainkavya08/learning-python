# Why was this code better?
# Ans --> Because the code stops if it gets true right away and doesn't take system memory

x = int(input ("What's x ? "))
y= int(input ("What's y ? "))

if x < y:    #Boolean Expression
    print ("x is less than y ")
elif x > y:
    print ("x is greater than y")
elif x == y:
    print ("x equals y ")
